Initialize a counter for array access operations.

Read integers from the file and store them in a non-decreasing order in the array.

Prompt the user to input a number for which a matching sum is needed.

Implement nested loops to iterate over the array elements, checking all pairs (A[i], A[j]).

Inside the nested loops, for each pair, compare the sum A[i] + A[j] with the user-input number.

If a matching sum is found, print the indices i and j, along with the values A[i] and A[j].

Print the total count of array access operations.

If no matching sum is found after iterating through all pairs, report failure and print the total count of array access operations.

Terminate the program after reporting the results.
