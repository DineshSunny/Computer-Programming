Heap memory (allocated with new) has addresses far from stack variables.

Example from angletest8.cpp:

&i1 (stack) = 0x7ffee2a4
new int (heap) = 0x600000e8


Explanation:

Stack grows downward in memory, close-packed.

Heap grows upward, managed by memory allocator, usually high addresses.

Therefore, stack and heap addresses are clearly separated.
