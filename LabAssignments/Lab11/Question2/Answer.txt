Question 2 (Written Answer)

Stack variables (i1, i2, x1, x2, etc.) are stored close together.

Arrays (A[6], char c[11]) occupy contiguous stack memory.

Objects (angle a1, a2) take more space, but still live on the stack.

Pointers (ip1, fp1, etc.) are stack variables, but their values are addresses (pointing to stack or heap later).

Heap allocations (see Q5/Q6) have addresses far from stack because stack and heap are managed in different memory regions.
