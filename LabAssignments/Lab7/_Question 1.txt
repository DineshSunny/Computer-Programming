Question 1:

The parameters that will specify the array and the input filestream are:

An input file stream object, to read the data from the input file

An array of float values, to store the data read from the input file

The header for the function readSortedArray will be:

int readSortedArray(ifstream& in, float arr[], int size)
where

"in" is the input file stream object

"arr" is the array of float values to store the data read from the input file

"size" is the size of the array
